\subsubsection{Pick's Theorem}
For a simple polygon, its area $A$ can be written as $A = i + \frac b2 - 1$ in which $i$ is the number of points that are strictly interior to the polygon and $b$ is the number of points that are on the polygon's boundary.
\subsubsection{Euler's Planar Graph Theorem}
F: number of regions bounded by edges. \\
\(V - E + F = C + 1, E \le 3V - 6\)
