\subsubsection{Pick's Theorem}
For a simple polygon, its area $A$ can be written as $A = i + \frac b2 - 1$ in which $i$ is the number of points that are strictly interior to the polygon and $b$ is the number of points that are on the polygon's boundary.
\subsubsection{Euler's Planar Graph Theorem}
\(F\): number of regions bounded by edges. \\
\(V - E + F = C + 1, E \le 3V - 6\)
\subsubsection{Modular inversion recurrence}
For some prime \(p\),
\[
inv_i = \begin{cases}
    1 & i = 1 \\
    p - \lfloor \frac{p}{i} \rfloor \times inv_{(p \mod i)} & 1 < i < p
\end{cases}
\]
